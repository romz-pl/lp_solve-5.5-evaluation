 MEMO: lp_solve version 5.5.2.11 for 64 bit OS, with 64 bit REAL variables.
      In the total iteration count 1395012, 59621 (4.3%) were bound flips.
      There were 128283 refactorizations, 0 triggered by time and 1 by density.
       ... on average 10.4 major pivots per refactorization.
      The largest [LUSOL v2.2.1.0] fact(B) had 2062 NZ entries, 1.0x largest basis.
      The maximum B&B level was 202, 0.2x MIP order, with 201290 nodes explored.
      The constraint matrix inf-norm is 560, with a dynamic range of 560.
