Using DUAL simplex for phase 1 and PRIMAL simplex for phase 2.
The primal and dual simplex pricing strategy set to 'Devex'.
 
Found feasibility by dual simplex after          3228 iter.
lp_solve unsuccessful after 3301 iter and a last best value of 0

 MEMO: lp_solve version 5.5.2.11 for 64 bit OS, with 64 bit REAL variables.
      In the total iteration count 3301, 0 (0.0%) were bound flips.
      There were 45 refactorizations, 0 triggered by time and 3 by density.
       ... on average 73.4 major pivots per refactorization.
      The largest [LUSOL v2.2.1.0] fact(B) had 401648 NZ entries, 1.0x largest basis.
      The constraint matrix inf-norm is 1, with a dynamic range of 4177.09.
      Time to load data was 0.209 seconds, presolve used 0.072 seconds,
