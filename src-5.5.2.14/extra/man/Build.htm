					<h1 align="left"><u>Calling the lpsolve API from your application</u></h1>
					<p>There are two ways to call the lpsolve API from an application:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Dynamically</li>
						<li>Statically</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Dynamically means that the lpsolve code is dynamically linked to your code. This means that
					it is linked to your program when the executable is started or even only when you make calls
					to the lpsolve library. The lpsolve library is then not linked with the executable and is
					provided in a separate file. Under Windows this is a dll (lpsolve55.dll), under Unix/Linux
					this is a shared library (liblpsolve55.so). You must distribute this separate library with
					your program to make it work. The library must be located on a place that can be found by
					the program. There are several advantages of this way of working. Almost all programming
					languages have a way to call dynamic libraries or even can only call libraries that way.
					One example is VB6. Another advantage is that it is easier to update the package. The program
					doesn't have to be recompiled/relinked. You only have to provide a new lpsolve library.
					</p>

					<p>Statically means that the lpsolve code is statically linked to the code. This means
					that the program does not need extra files to be able to call lpsolve since the
					code is already contained in the executable. The executable will thus be larger. This can
					only be done if you have the source code of your program and you can recompile it and link
					it with the lpsolve code. Not all programming languages have the possibility to statically link
					code. For example VB6 does not have a way to do that. The advantage of this way
					of calling the lpsolve library is that you don't have to provide extra files with your
					executable since the library is already in the exe. The disadvantage is that you must recompile
					(or at least link) the program with the lpsolve code when an update of lpsolve is needed.
					There are two ways to link your application with lpsolve. The first way is
					add the needed lpsolve source code to the project and compile it together as one unit. This is
					most probably only possible when the code is also written in C/C++ (however not always since for
					example .NET allows to link for example C# code with C code). The disadvantage of this
					way of working is that you have to revise your project when you use a new version of lpsolve since
					there could be files added or removed in the lpsolve package. Also you may have to
					define some defines. A better way of working is making use of the lpsolve library. Under
					DOS/Windows this is called liblpsolve55.lib (liblpsolve55d.lib in debug mode),
					under Unix/Linux liblpsolve55.a. The advantages are
					that other languages (like Pascal) can also link with such a library, your project is not
					overloaded with the lpsolve source files and also not unimportant, the linker only takes the
					code from the library that you really use resulting in a smaller executable. One disadvantage
					is that you cannot debug and step trough the lpsolve code then, if you would want to do that.

					<a name="Dynamically link your application with lpsolve"></a>
					<h4><u>Dynamically link your application with lpsolve</u></h4>

					  <p>lpsolve is separated from the application. So there are two separate compilations. One
					  of the application and one of the lpsolve library. Most people will not compile the
					  lpsolve library themselves since it is provided for several popular platforms.
					  The files are in <b>lp_solve_5.5.2.14_dev.zip</b> for Windows and <b>lp_solve_5.5_dev.gz</b> for Linux.
					  Therefore it
					  is first explained how to access the lpsolve library in your application. This depends
					  on the OS and the calling language. The most common are described here.</p>

					  There are two ways of linking a dynamic library to the application: Implicit and Explicit
					  linking. It depends on the programming language which way of linking is supported. Some
					  support only one of the two, some can do both ways.

					  <table><tr><td width=20></td><td>
						<a name="Implicit linking with the lpsolve dynamic library"></a>
						<h5><u>Implicit linking with the lpsolve dynamic library</u></h5>

						<p>With Implicit Linking, the shared library file gets loaded into memory as soon as we
						execute the client program. If implicitly linked, the library is not removed from memory unless
						the application is terminated. However, if there are other applications in memory that are
						using the library, it is not removed from memory till the last of these applications is terminated.</p>

						<p>If Implicit Linking is used, a link (or import) library must be provided to the linker to resolve
						the symbols. In the code, the function calls are made as if all symbols are available.</p>

						<a name="Explicit linking with the lpsolve dynamic library"></a>
						<h5><u>Explicit linking with the lpsolve dynamic library</u></h5>

						<p>If we want, we can defer the loading of the library till the time a call to the exported function
						in the library is not made. This is known as Explicit Linking. Explicit linking is more appropriate for
						interpreted languages such as Visual Basic, but it can also be used from C/C++ if we need to.</p>

						<p>If Explicit Linking is used, the library is explicitly loaded in memory via a special API
						call and the routines are also explicitly called via API calls. It should be clear that
						Explicit linking requires more coding than Implicit linking, but it allows you do load the
						library only when you need it and even decide at runtime from which library to call the routines.</p>
					  </td></tr></table>

					  <p>Some may see Implicit linking as 'early binding' and Explicit linking as 'late binding'.
					  Although it is not exactly the same, the analogy is true. Just like 'early binding', with
					  Implicit linking, the symbols are resolved and checked at compile (actually link) time.
					  There is strong type checking and less chance to pass wrong arguments. Just like 'late binding',
					  with Explicit linking, the symbols are resolved and checked at runtime. The type checking is
					  loose and there is chance that wrong parameters are passed to the function with possible
					  disastrous results. But with the flexibility to dynamically load and call functions.<br>
					  For Windows, there is a good article explaining all this: <a href="http://iaci.unq.edu.ar/materias/Inst_avanz/web/..%5CDll%5CDLLs%20for%20Beginners.pdf">DLLs for Beginners</a></p>

					  <table ID="Table3"><tr><td width=20></td><td>
					  <h5>WINDOWS: Call the lpsolve dll from C/C++</h5>

					  <table ID="Table6"><tr><td width=20></td><td>

					  <p>Microsoft Visual C/C++ and GNU gcc support both Implicit and Explicit linking.
					  In both cases, some header files are also needed. They are included with the archive
					  where the libraries are also in <b>lp_solve_5.5.2.14_dev.zip</b> and <b>lp_solve_5.5_dev.gz</b>.
					  Only lp_lib.h must be included in your source code. The other header files are included
					  by this master include file.</p>

					  <h6>Implicit linking</h6>

					  <p>In implicit linking, the linker matches the symbols of the library via a .lib file (the import library).
					  Note the extension of the file. This is the same as for a static library. This may be confusing. There is
					  a big difference between a static library and an import library. It is unfortunate that Microsoft has used
					  the same extension for both. A static library contains code and it is statically linked to the executable.
					  An import library only contains symbol definitions so that the linker can resolve the symbols. An import
					  library will thus be much smaller in size than a static library.
					  This file is provided with the lpsolve dll and is called <b>lpsolve55.lib</b> (both in archive <b>lp_solve_5.5.2.14_dev.zip</b>).
					  It depends on the environment and the version how to
					  do this. Via the link.exe command, this is done by just specifying the lpsolve55.lib file at
					  the command line. Via the .NET environment, this can be done via:
					  Project, Properties, Linker, Input, Additional Dependencies. Optionally it is possible to
					  also specify a link path via Project, Properties, Linker, General, Additional Library Directories.
					  In Visual studio 6, this can be done via:
					  Project, Settings, Link, Category General, Object/library modules. Optionally it is possible to
					  also specify a link path via Project, Settings, Link, Category Input, Additional library path.<br>
					  After this is done, the lpsolve functions can be called just like the lpsolve functions are linked
					  to the program.</p>

					  <p>Example:</p>

					  <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#include "lp_lib.h"

main()
{
  lprec *lp;

  lp = make_lp(0,4);

  /* ... */

  delete_lp(lp);
}</pre>

					  <h6>Explicit linking</h6>

					  <p>In explicit linking we don't use the .lib file. Instead we call the Win32 <B>LoadLibrary( )</B>
					  function, specifying the DLL's pathname as a parameter. The <B>LoadLibrary( )</B> function returns
					  an HINSTANCE parameter. This parameter is used in a call to the <B>GetProcAddress( )</B>
					  function to fetch the address of the function to be called. This address is a pointer to a
					  function. Through this pointer the function is finally called. As can be seen in the following
					  example, this requires some extra coding.<br>
					  <br>
					  Example:</p>

					  <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#include "lp_lib.h"

main()
{
  lprec *lp;
  HINSTANCE lpsolve;
  make_lp_func *_make_lp;
  delete_lp_func *_delete_lp;

  lpsolve = LoadLibrary("lpsolve55.dll");

  if (lpsolve == NULL) {
    printf("Unable to load lpsolve shared library\n");
    return(FALSE);
  }
  _make_lp = (make_lp_func *) GetProcAddress(lpsolve, "make_lp");
  _delete_lp = (delete_lp_func *) GetProcAddress(lpsolve, "delete_lp");

  lp = _make_lp(0,4);

  /* ... */

  _delete_lp(lp);

  FreeLibrary(lpsolve);
}</pre>

					  <p>Note that the prototype definitions of the lpsolve functions (ex make_lp_func) are already
					  defined in lp_lib.h. This same code also works with the Windows gnu gcc compiler. The only thing
					  that must be done at compile time is defining the WIN32 macro. This will make sure that the
					  calling convention will be __stdcall as required.</p>

					  <p>The C demo example (<b>lp_solve_5.5_c.tar.gz</b>) demonstrates both implicit and explicit linking.</p>

					  <p>The following batch/script files can be used to compile the demo's from the command line:</p>

					  <table border=1>
						<tr>
						  <td valign="top">cvc6.bat</td>
						  <td>Compile the demo with the Microsoft Visual C compiler.
						      It generates demoi.exe, demoe.exe, demos.exe.

						      Also note that the lpsolve55.dll file must also be compiled with gcc for this to work.</td>

						<p>The lpsolve code is in a library file. The files are in <b>lp_solve_5.5.2.14_dev.zip</b> for Windows and <b>lp_solve_5.5_dev.gz</b> for Linux.
						Under Windows with the Microsoft compiler, this is in a .lib file.

						<a name="Link your code with the lpsolve source code"></a>
						<h5><u>Link your code with the lpsolve source code</u></h5>

						<p>The lpsolve source code is linked with your code. The lpsolve source
						code is contained in archive <b>lp_solve_5.5_source.tar.gz</b>.
						This is the most complex method and should only be used when the others don't work.</p>

						<p>One note in advance. Your C/C++ compiler must know 64 bit integers.
						Most today compilers support this trough the data type long long.
						lp_solve uses a define LLONG for this. If your compiler doesn't support long long, but
						it supports 64 bit integers trough another name, then you can define LLONG to this
						type at the compiler command line. For example -DLLONG=int64.
                                                Also some older (versions of) compilers only support long long via an additional switch.
                                                For example previous gcc compilers need the switch -std=c99 at the gcc compile command
                                                to enable ISO C99. Without this switch a warning is given like
                                                "warning: ISO C90 does not support `long long'".</p>

						<p>The following source files must at least be added to your project:</p>

<pre>
bfp/bfp_LUSOL/lp_LUSOL.c
bfp/bfp_LUSOL/LUSOL/lusol.c
colamd/colamd.c
ini.c
shared/commonlib.c
shared/mmio.c
shared/myblas.c
lp_crash.c
lp_Hash.c
lp_lib.c
lp_matrix.c
lp_MDO.c
lp_mipbb.c
lp_MPS.c
lp_params.c
lp_presolve.c
lp_price.c
lp_pricePSE.c
lp_report.c
lp_scale.c
lp_simplex.c
lp_SOS.c
lp_utils.c
lp_wlp.c
</pre>

						<p>All header (.h) files from lpsolve must be accessible. Most compilers use the directive
						-Ipath with path the location to the header files. Note that the colamd, bfp and bfp/bfp_etaPFI directories
						also contain header files that must be included.<br><br>
						If you also need the lp parser to read an lp model (<A href="read_lp.htm">read_lp, read_LP</A>)
						then you must also include the files lp_rlp.c and yacc_read.c and define the symbol PARSER_LP.
						Most compilers use the directive -DPARSER_LP to do that. If you forget to define this symbol
						then the linker will give a link error saying that the symbols read_lp, read_LP are already
						defined. Also define the symbol YY_NEVER_INTERACTIVE (-DYY_NEVER_INTERACTIVE). This to disable the
						interactive mode of the lex parser and remove the dependency on isatty() routine which not
						available in all environments.</p>

						<p>Note that lp_rlp.c, lp_rlp.h may give you some warnings when they are compiled.
						This is 'normal'. These files are not human-written, but generated from yacc/bison/lex tools from the
						corresponding .y and .l files. These tools don't seem to care much in generating code that is fully
						Ansi compliant and without warnings. Normally they can be ignored.</p>

						<p>Note that there are more .c files in the lpsolve directory. You don't have to (even may not) include
						these in your project also. This because there files are either automatically included by the
						other source files or are needed for other functionality.
						</p>

						<p>With the Windows Microsoft compiler, the compilation command could be:</p>

						<code>
						cl -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5 -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5\bfp -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5\bfp\bfp_etaPFI -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5\colamd /Zp8 -DWIN32 %src% -o MyExe.exe
						</code>

						<p>With the Windows gnu compiler, the command could be:</p>

						<code>
						gcc -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5 -DBFP_CALLMODEL=__stdcall %src% -o MyExe.exe
						</code>

						<p>Under Unix/Linux, the command could be:</p>

						<code>
						cc -I/lp_solve_5.5 -I/lp_solve_5.5/bfp -I/lp_solve_5.5/bfp/bfp_etaPFI -I/lp_solve_5.5/colamd $src -o MyExe.exe -lm -ldl
						</code>

						<p>%src% / $src is an environment variable containing all source files (above lpsolve source files plus your sources).
						Note the /Zp8 option with the Windows c compiler.
						This is also important. It ensures 8-bit alignment. This is required when you make use of the BPF functionality
						(see <a href="BFP.htm">Basis Factorization Packages</a>) and the XLI functionality (see <a href="XLI.htm">External Language Interfaces</a>).
						It doesn't matter which calling convention is used.
						__cdecl or __stdcall or any other calling convention is ok, even if you make use of the BFP functionality.
						Note the -DBFP_CALLMODEL=__stdcall option with the non-Microsoft compiler. This
						is to define a macro for the BFP to make sure its routines are called via the __stdcall calling convention.
						This is required if you want to make use of the BFP functionality. If your compiler doesn't
						provide a way to specify the __stdcall calling convention, then you can drop this, but the
						BFP functionality will then probably not work (even crash). With the Microsoft compiler this option
						doesn't have to be specified because it is automatically set by the lpsolve header files via
						the WIN32 macro. Under Unix/Linux the -lm option must be added to link with the math library and
						the option -ldl is used to link with the shared library. Not all Unix systems have this
						functionality. In that case you can drop the -ldl option but then you have to add
						-DLoadInverseLib=0 -DLoadLanguageLib=0 in which case you will not be able to use the BFP
						functionality (see <a href="BFP.htm">Basis Factorization Packages</a>) and also not the
						XLI functionality (see <a href="XLI.htm">External Language Interfaces</a>).</p>

						<p>The compiler commands to compile the package with also the lp (lpsolve and CPLEX) parser functionality:<br>
						With the Windows Microsoft compiler, the command could be:</p>

						<code>cl -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5 -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5\bfp -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5\bfp\bfp_etaPFI -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5\colamd /Zp8 -DWIN32 -DYY_NEVER_INTERACTIVE -DPARSER_LP %src% -o MyExe.exe</code>

						<p>With the Windows gnu compiler, the command could be:</p>

						<code>gcc -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5 -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5\bfp -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5\bfp\bfp_etaPFI -Ic:\lp_solve_5.5\colamd -DBFP_CALLMODEL=__stdcall -DYY_NEVER_INTERACTIVE -DPARSER_LP %src% -o MyExe.exe</code>

						<p>Under Unix/Linux, the command could be:</p>

						<code>cc -I/lp_solve_5.5 -I/lp_solve_5.5/bfp -I/lp_solve_5.5/bfp/bfp_etaPFI -I/lp_solve_5.5/colamd -DYY_NEVER_INTERACTIVE -DPARSER_LP $src -o MyExe.exe -lm -ldl</code>

						<p>And for Unix/Linux without the possibility to use the BFP and XLI functionality:</p>

						<code>cc -I/lp_solve_5.5 -I/lp_solve_5.5/bfp -I/lp_solve_5.5/bfp/bfp_etaPFI -I/lp_solve_5.5/colamd -DYY_NEVER_INTERACTIVE -DPARSER_LP -DLoadInverseLib=0 -DLoadLanguageLib=0 $src -o MyExe.exe -lm</code>

						<p>Note that I used here the command prompt commands to compile the sources. It is of course also possible
						to use the graphical interfaces with their project files to build it. The principle stays however the same.</p>

						<p>In the lp_solve folder, there are also some batch/script files to build the lp_solve application.
						This may be a good start to begin. Note that lp_solve.c is here the application. It only contains this one source file.
						Or you could also look at the demo program in the demo directory. Here the application is demo.c</p>
