					<h1 align="left"><u>Formulation of an lp problem in lpsolve</u></h1>

<p>We shall illustrate the method of linear programming by means of a simple example,
giving a combination graphical/numerical solution, and then solve the problem in lpsolve in different ways.
This via ASCII files and from different programming languages.</p>

<p>Suppose a farmer has 75 acres on which to plant two crops: wheat and barley.
To produce these crops, it costs the farmer (for seed, fertilizer, etc.) $120 per acre for the
wheat and  $210 per acre for the barley. The farmer has $15000 available for expenses.
But after the harvest, the farmer must store the crops while awaiting favourable market conditions.
The farmer has storage space for 4000 bushels. Each acre yields an average of 110 bushels of wheat
or 30 bushels of barley.  If the net profit per bushel of wheat (after all expenses have been subtracted)
is $1.30 and for barley is $2.00, how should the farmer plant the 75 acres to maximize profit?</p>

<p>We begin by formulating the problem mathematically. 
First we express the objective, that is the profit, and the constraints
algebraically, then we graph them, and lastly we arrive at the solution
by graphical inspection and a minor arithmetic calculation.</p>

<p>Let x denote the number of acres allotted to wheat and y the number of acres allotted to barley.
Then the expression to be maximized, that is the profit, is clearly</p>

<p align="center">P = (110)(1.30)x + (30)(2.00)y = 143x + 60y.</p>

<p>There are three constraint inequalities, specified by the limits on expenses, storage and acreage.
They are respectively:</p>

<p align="center">
120x + 210y &lt;= 15000<br>
110x + 30y &lt;= 4000<br>
x + y &lt;= 75
</p>

<p>Strictly speaking there are two more constraint inequalities forced by the fact that the farmer cannot plant
a negative number of acres, namely:</p>

<p align="center">x &gt;= 0, y &gt;= 0.</p>

<p>Next we graph the regions specified by the constraints. The last two say that we only need to consider
the first quadrant in the x-y plane. Here's a graph delineating the triangular region in the first quadrant determined
by the first inequality.</p>

<p><IMG alt="Source" src="O-Matrix1.jpg" border="0"></p>

<p>Now let's put in the other two constraint inequalities.</p>

<p><IMG alt="Source" src="O-Matrix2.jpg" border="0"></p>

<p>The black area is the solution space that holds valid solutions. This means that any point in this area fulfils the
constraints.
</p>

<p>Now let's superimpose on top of this picture a contour plot of the objective function P.</p>

<p><IMG alt="Source" src="O-Matrix3.jpg" border="0"></p>

<p>The lines give a picture of the objective function.
All solutions that intersect with the black area are valid solutions, meaning that this result also fulfils
the set constraints. The more the lines go to the right, the higher the objective value is. The optimal solution
or best objective is a line that is still in the black area, but with an as large as possible value.
</p>

<p>It seems apparent that the maximum value of P will occur on the level curve (that is, level
line) that passes through the vertex of the polygon that lies near (22,53).<br>
It is the intersection of x + y = 75 and 110*x + 30*y = 4000<br>
This is a corner point of the diagram. This is not a coincidence. The simplex algorithm, which is used
by lpsolve, starts from a theorem that the optimal solution is such a corner point.<br>
In fact we can compute the result:</p>

<pre>
x + y = 75          (1)
110*x + 30*y = 4000 (2)
</pre>

<p>From (1), y can be expressed in function of x:</p>

<pre>
y = 75 - x (3)
</pre>

<p>This equation can be substituted in (2):</p>

<pre>
110*x + 30*(75 - x) = 4000
</pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre>
80*x = 1750
</pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre>
x = 21.875
</pre>

<p>From (3), y can be derived:</p>

<pre>
y = 75 - 21.875 = 53.125
</pre>

<p>The acreage that results in the maximum profit is 21.875 for wheat and 53.125 for barley.
In that case the profit is:</p>

<pre>
P = 143*x + 60*y
</pre>

<p>Or:</p>

P = 143*21.875 + 60*53.125 = 6326.625

<p>That is, $6315.625.</p>

<p>Now, lpsolve comes into the picture to solve this linear programming problem more generally.</p>

<p>First let us show this problem in its mathematical format:</p>

<pre>
max(143x + 60y)
s.t.
120x + 210y &lt;= 15000
110x + 30y &lt;= 4000
x + y &lt;= 75
x &gt;= 0
y &gt;= 0
</pre>

is formulated as follows in MPS format:</p>

<h4><u>Construct the model from a Programming Language.</u></h4>

<p>In several cases it is required that the solver is called from within the programming language
in which an application is build. All the data is in memory and no files are created to provide data
to the solver. lpsolve has a very rich, yet easy, API to do this.
See <a href="lp_solveAPIreference.htm">lp_solve API reference</a> for an overview of the API.
lpsolve is a library of API routines. This library is called from the programming language.
See <a href="Build.htm">Calling the lpsolve API from your application</a> for more information.

Above example is now formulated in several programming languages:</p>
