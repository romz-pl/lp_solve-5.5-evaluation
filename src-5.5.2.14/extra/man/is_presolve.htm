The routine also detects implicit duplicate slacks from inequality constraints, fixes and removes the redundant variable. This latter removal also tends to reduce the risk of degeneracy. The combined function of this option can have a dramatic simplifying effect on some models.

					<p class="label"><b>Remarks</b></p>
					<p>The <b>is_presolve</b> function returns a flag if the presolve level specified
						in <i>testmask</i> is active. Presolve looks at the model and tries to simplify
						it so that solving times are shorter. For example a constraint on only one
						variable is converted to a bound on this variable (and the constraint is
						deleted). Note that the model dimensions can change because of this, so be
						careful with this. Both rows and columns can be deleted by the presolve.<br>
						The default is not (FALSE) doing a presolve.
					</p>
					<p class="label"><b>Example</b></p>
					<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "lp_lib.h"

int main(void)
{
  lprec *lp;
  int presolve;

  /* Create a new LP model */
  lp = make_lp(0, 0);
  if(lp == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Unable to create new LP model\n");
    return(1);
  }

  presolve = is_presolve(lp, PRESOLVE_ROWS | PRESOLVE_COLS); /* Will return FALSE */

  delete_lp(lp);
  return(0);
}
