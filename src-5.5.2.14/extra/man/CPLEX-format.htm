					<p><h1 align="left"><u>CPLEX lp files</u></h1>
					<p>The CPLEX LP file format provides a facility for entering a problem in a
						natural, algebraic LP formulation from the keyboard. The problem can be
						modified and saved from within lpsolve. This procedure is one way to create a
						file in a format that lpsolve can read. An alternative technique is to create a
						similar file using a standard text editor and to read it into lpsolve.</p>

					<P>The CPLEX LP format is provided as an input alternative to the MPS file format.
						An LP format file may be easier to generate than an MPS file if your problem
						already exists in an algebraic format or if you have an application that
						generates the problem file more readily in algebraic format (such as a C
						application).</P>

					<p>Note that the CPLEX LP format is not the same as the lpsolve LP format.
					   See <a href="lp-format.htm">LP file format</a> for a description about
					   the native lpsolve lp format. To read/write this format from lpsolve, you need
					   an XLI (see <a href="XLI.htm">External Language Interfaces</a>). The XLI for the CPLEX
					   format is called xli_CPLEX.</p>

                    <h3>Options</h3>
                    <p>The XLI accepts several options:</p>

                    <h4>Reading</h4>
<pre>
  -objconst      Allow constants in the objective (default).
  -noobjconst    Don't allow constants in the objective.
</pre>
					<p>Note that CPLEX doesn't allow constants in the objective (until at least v10).
					   However, the lp_solve XLI does allow it by default.
					   Use the option -noobjconst if these should not be allowed.
					   The parser will then give an error.</p>

                    <h4>Writing</h4>
<pre>
  -objconst      Allow constants in the objective.
  -noobjconst    Don't use constants in the objective (default).
</pre>

					<p>Note that CPLEX doesn't allow constants in the objective (until at least v10).
					   However, the lp_solve XLI does allow it when the option -objconst is used.
					   By default or when the option -noobjconst is used, a constant in the objective
					   is translated to a variable objconst_term with a bound equal to the constant set
					   to it. So no error is generated when there is a constant.</p>

					<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
lp_solve -rxli xli_CPLEX input.lpt
lp_solve -mps input.mps -wxli xli_CPLEX output.lpt -wxliopt "-objconst"
</pre>

                    <h3>Syntax Rules of LP File Format</h3>
					<P>lpsolve will accept any problem saved in an ASCII file provided that it adheres
						to the following syntax rules.

							the rest of the file and must be at the beginning of a line. The maximum length for any

To specify special ordered
sets, use a SOS section, which is preceded by the SOS keyword. The SOS
section should follow the Bounds, General, Binaries and Semi-Continuous
sections. Special ordered sets of type 1 require that, of the variables
in the set, one at most may be non-zero. Special ordered sets of type 2
require that at most two variables in the set may be non-zero, and if
there are two non-zeros, they must be adjacent. Adjacency is defined by
the weights, which must be unique within a set given to the variables.
The sorted weights define the order of the special ordered set. For MIP
branch and cut, the order is used to determine how the variables are
branched upon. The set is specified by an optional set name followed
by a colon and then either of the S1 or S2 keywords (specifying the type)
followed by a double colon. The set member names are
listed on this line or lines, with their weights. Variable names and
weights are separated by a colon, for example:
