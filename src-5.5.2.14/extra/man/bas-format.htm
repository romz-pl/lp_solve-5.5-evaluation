					<h1 align="left"><u>MPS bas file format</u></h1>

<P>
The MPS format can also be used to specify some predefined basis for an
LP problem, i.e. to specify which rows and columns are basic and which
are non-basic.</p>

<p>
As in the MPS format, a number of fields are defined on fixed column positions:
</p>
<pre>
Field:    1           2          3         4         5         6
Columns:  2-3        5-12      15-22     25-36     40-47     50-61
</pre>

<P>
The order of a basis file in the MPS format is:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>NAME indicator card;</li>
	<li>data cards (can appear in arbitrary order);</li>
	<li>ENDATA indicator card.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Any line with an asterisk (*) in Column 1 is treated as a comment.
</p>

<p>
The NAME card can have anything you want, starting in column 15.<br>
lp_solve sets the number of iterations, the number of rows and number of columns of the model to the <code>NAME</code> record.
</p>

<p>
The eight character names used to specify variables and constraints
entities are fixed format. Names are not automatically justified,
so blanks are treated just like other characters. For example "ROW1    "
is not the same as " ROW1   ". (Note that some optimisers do not permit
blanks in names.) No case conversion is performed, so "row1    " is
different from "ROW1    ".
</p>

<P>
Each data card specifies either a pair "basic column--non-basic row"
or a non-basic column. All the data cards have the following format.
</p>

<P>
'<code>XL</code>' in the field 1 means that a column, whose name is given in
the field 2, is basic, and a row, whose name is given in the field 3,
is non-basic and placed on its lower bound.</p>

<P>
'<code>XU</code>' in the field 1 means that a column, whose name is given in
the field 2, is basic, and a row, whose name is given in the field 3,
is non-basic and placed on its upper bound.</p>

<P>
'<code>LL</code>' in the field 1 means that a column, whose name is given in
the field 3, is non-basic and placed on its lower bound.</p>

<P>
'<code>UL</code>' in the field 1 means that a column, whose name is given in
the field 3, is non-basic and placed on its upper bound.</p>

<P>
The field 2 contains a column name.</p>

<P>
If the indicator given in the field 1 is '<code>XL</code>' or '<code>XU</code>',
the field 3 contains a row name. Otherwise, if the indicator is
'<code>LL</code>' or '<code>UL</code>', the field 3 is not used and should be empty.</p>

<P>
The field 4, 5, and 6 are not used and should be empty.</p>

<Table Border="3" ID="Table1">
<tr><th align=left><b>Value</b></th><th align=left><b>Status</b></th></tr>
<tr><td><code>XU</code></td><td>Variable 1 is basic; variable 2 is nonbasic at its upper bound</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>XL</code></td><td>Variable 1 is basic; variable 2 is nonbasic at its lower bound</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>UL</code></td><td>Variable 1 is nonbasic and is at its upper bound</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>LL</code></td><td>Variable 1 is nonbasic and is at its lower bound</td></tr>
</Table>

<p>
Field 1: Indicator specifying status of the named variables in Fields 2 and 3.</p>
<p>
Field 2: Variable 1 identifier</p>
<p>
Field 3: Variable 2 identifier (ignored if Field 1 is <code>UL</code> or <code>LL</code>)</p>
<p>
Variable 1 specifies a structural variable identifier which has entered
the basis. By convention, this structural variable must displace one of
the row variables. Variable 2 is a row variable that has left the
basis. No relationship between structural variables entering the basis
and row variables leaving the basis is implied within the BAS file.</p>

<P>
A basis file in the MPS format acts like a patch: it doesn't specify
a basis completely, instead that it is just shows in what a given basis
differs from the "standard" basis, where all rows (auxiliary variables)
are assumed to be basic and all columns (structural variables) are
assumed to be non-basic.</p>

<p>
A basis defines a list of basic structural variables and row variables.
A <em>structural variable</em> is one of the variables (columns) defined in the MPS problem file.
A <em>row variable</em> is actually the slack, surplus, or artificial variable associated with
a row. The total number of basic variables-both structural and row-is
equal to the number of rows in the constraint matrix. Additionally, the
number of basic structural variables is equal to the number of nonbasic
row variables. By convention, an MPS basis file is built on the
assumption that all row variables are basic and that all structural
variables are nonbasic with values at their lower bound. The data
records in a BAS file list structural and row variables that violate
this assumption. This convention minimizes the size of the BAS file.
