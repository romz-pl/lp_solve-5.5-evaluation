					<h1 align="left"><u>Sensitivity</u></h1>
					<p>Sensitivity or post-optimal analysis is extra information that is provided about 
						the current optimal solution. <b>lp_solve</b> provides a substantial amount of 
						sensitivity information. Several API calls are available to retrieve the 
						sensitivity: <A href="get_sensitivity_obj.htm">get_sensitivity_obj, 
							get_ptr_sensitivity_obj, get_sensitivity_objex, get_ptr_sensitivity_objex</A>,
						<A href="get_sensitivity_rhs.htm">get_sensitivity_rhs, get_ptr_sensitivity_rhs, 
							get_dual_solution, get_ptr_dual_solution, get_var_dualresult</A>. The 
						lp_solve program doesn't show the sensitivity by default. So to see the 
						sensitivity information, use the -S4 option. The best way to explain this is 
						via an example.</p>

					<p>
						First look at 'Objective function limits' (via API obtained by <A href="get_sensitivity_obj.htm">
							get_sensitivity_obj, get_ptr_sensitivity_obj, get_sensitivity_objex, 
							get_ptr_sensitivity_objex</A>). There is a list of all variables with for 
						each variable 3 values. <i>From</i>, <i>Till</i> and <i>FromValue</i>. <i>From - 
							Till</i> gives the limits where between the objective value may vary so 
						that the solution stays the same. For example, variable COLFOUR has a <i>From</i>
						value of 0 and a <i>Till</i> value of 0.1111679. The coefficient in the objective function of 
						this variable is 0.1. This means 
						that as this coefficient varies between 0 and 0.1111679, the solution 
						doesn't change. The values for the variables and the constraints will remain 
						unchanged as long as the objective coefficient stays in this range. The objective function value 
						will vary of course and also the sensitivity information of the other 
						variables, but the solution will stay the same if only the objective coefficient value for this variable is changed.
						When the objective coefficient of variable 
						COLFOUR is above 0.1111679 then the solution will change. The <i>FromValue</i> is 
						only meaningful if the variable has a value of 0 (rejected). This is the value 
						that this variable becomes when the <i>From</i> (minimization) or <i>Till</i> (maximization) 
						value is reached. For example, the variable COLTWO that has an amount of 0 will 
						become 0.5123946 if the coefficient in the objective function of COLTWO reaches 2.698621. Note that you only 
						get information about this variable. There is no information what the values 
						will be of the other variables. In a blending example where the coefficients of 
						the objective function are generally the prices of ingredients this 
						information tells you at what point a price may change to have the same 
						composition and the FromValue says at what value a relected ingredient will be taken when
						the price lowers till the lower range value.</p>
					<P>Another piece of information are the Dual values with the <i>from - till</i> limits. 
						This is provided for both the constraints and the variables. The information is 
						the same for both. For example, constraint THISROW has a dual value of 
						0.03448276 with a <i>From</i> value of 52.2 and a <i>Till</i> value of 142.042. 
						This means that the Dual value specifies how much the objective function will 
						vary if the constraint value is incremented by one unit. This implies that 
						there is only a non-zero dual value if the constraint is active. Constraint 
						THATROW for example is not active because the constraint is &lt;= 14.8, but its 
						value is only 6.864. However constraint THISROW is &gt;= 92.3 and its value is 
						also 92.3, thus active. If the constraint is changed to 93.3 (+1), then the 
						objective value will be the current value + change * dual value = 31.7828 + 1 * 
						0.03448276 = 31.81728. However this is only true for the range <i>From - Till</i>, which 
						means that the dual value stays only the same as long as the constraint lies 
						between the <i>From - Till</i> limits. The moment that you are outside of these limits, 
						the dual value will change. The dual value gives a very good indication how 
						much this restriction costs. If the dual value is very high then this constraint 
						is very influential on the objective function and if you are able to change 
						it a bit then the solution will be much better. Also the sign of the dual 
						value has a meaning. A positive value means that as the restriction becomes 
						larger, the objective value will be larger, and as it becomes more negative, 
						the objective value will be smaller. Also note that changes in the 
						restrictions, even between the limits, <b>can</b> cause the solution to change. 
						The from - till limits only say that the cost will remain the same, nothing 
						less, nothing more.
					</P>
					<h4 align="left"><u>Inaccurate sensitivity analysis in a model with integer variables</u></h4>
					<A NAME="Inacurate_Sensitivity_Integer"></A>The sensitivity analysis doesn't 
					take the integer restrictions in account. This is almost impossible since it 
					would ask too much calculation time. In particular the <i>from - till</i> limits 
					on both the objective function and the dual values are trustworthy. They only 
					apply for the current solution without the integer restrictions. Keep this in 
					mind. The dual values are correct.
