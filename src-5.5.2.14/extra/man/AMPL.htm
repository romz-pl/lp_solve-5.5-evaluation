<h3>AMPL?</h3>
<p>AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) is a high-level language for describing mathematical
programs. AMPL allows a mathematical programming model to be specified independently of the data
used for a specific instance of the model. AMPL's language for describing mathematical programs closely
follows that used by humans to describe mathematical programs to each other. For this reason, modellers
may spend more time improving the model and less time on the tedious details of data manipulation and
problem solution.<br>
To start, AMPL needs a mathematical
programming model, which describes variables, objectives and relationships without referring to specific data.
AMPL also needs an instance of the data, or a particular data set. The model and one (or more) data files are
fed into the AMPL program. AMPL works like a compiler: the model and input are put into an intermediate
file that can be read by a solver. The solver actually finds an optimal solution to the problem by reading
in the intermediate file produced by AMPL and applying an appropriate algorithm. The solver outputs the
solution as a text file, which can be viewed directly and cross-referenced with the variables and constraints
specified in the model file.</p>

<p>We will not discuss the specifics of AMPL here but instead refer the reader to
<a href="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~murty/510/ampl.pdf">AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) at the University of
Michigan Documentation</a> and the AMPL website <A href="http://www.ampl.com" name=tex2html17>http://www.ampl.com</A>.
</p>

<h3>AMPL and lpsolve</h3>
<p>One of the possible solvers that can be used by AMPL is lpsolve. However note that AMPL allows also defining
non-linear models. These are not solvable by lpsolve because lpsolve can only handle MILP models. A message will
be given if the AMPL model results in a model that cannot be handled by lpsolve.
</p>

<p>To make this possible, a driver program is needed: lpsolve(.exe).
This program must be put in the AMPL directory and AMPL can call the lpsolve solver.
The newer versions of the lpsolve(.exe) driver call lpsolve via the shared library (lpsolve55.dll under Windows
and liblpsolve55.so under Unix/Linux). This has the advantage that the lpsolve driver program doesn't have to
be recompiled when an update of lpsolve is provided. The shared library must be somewhere in the path.
That is all.</p>

<h3>Solve a model from AMPL via lpsolve</h3>
<p>In the following text, ampl: before the AMPL commands is the AMPL prompt. Only the text after the : must be
entered.
</p>

<p>To select the lpsolve solver, the following command must be executed in AMPL:</p>

<pre>ampl: option solver lpsolve;</pre>

<p>To solve the model, the following command must be executed in AMPL:</p>

<pre>ampl: solve;</pre>

<p>Options can be passed to lpsolve. For example to enable scaling, the following command must be executed in AMPL:</p>

<pre>ampl: option lpsolve_options 'scale';</pre>

<p>Multiple options can be specified by separating them with at least one space:</p>

<pre>ampl: option lpsolve_options 'scale scalemode=7 verbose';</pre>

<p>A list of all options is given at the end of this document.</p>

<h3>An example</h3>
<pre>ampl: model diet.mod;
ampl: data diet.dat;
ampl: option solver lpsolve;
ampl: option lpsolve_options 'scale scalemode=7';
ampl: solve;
</pre>

<p>This gives as result:</p>

<pre>LP_SOLVE 5.5.2.14: scale
scalemode=7
LP_SOLVE 5.5.2.14: optimal, objective 88.2
1 simplex iterations
</pre>

<h3>solve_result_num</h3>
<p>AMPL has a parameter that is used to indicate the outcome of the
optimisation process. It is used as follows</p>

<pre>ampl: display solve_result_num</pre>

<p><TT>solve_result_num</TT> can take the values shown in following table which also presents a short
explanation for each value.</p>

<h3>Restart</h3>
This is also new with version 5. Before, when lpsolve was used from AMPL, the model was each time completely resolved
at each AMPL solve command. The last base was not used to do further iterations. This is specific to AMPL because
lpsolve is called as a seperate program each time a solve is done and to make restart possible the last base must be
provided again to lpsolve to start from there again.
From version 5 on this is now implemented by default. This means if a solve is done immediately after a previous
solve that no iterations are needed and the solution can be given immediately. This can be shown via an example:
<pre>ampl: model diet.mod;
ampl: data diet.dat;
ampl: option solver lpsolve;
ampl: solve;
</pre>

<p>This gives as result:</p>

<pre>LP_SOLVE 5.5.2.14: optimal, objective 88.2
3 simplex iterations
</pre>
<p>Note that 3 iterations were needed to solve the model.
Now solve the model again:</p>
<pre>ampl: solve;
</pre>

<p>This gives as result:</p>

<pre>LP_SOLVE 5.5.2.14: optimal, objective 88.2
0 simplex iterations
</pre>
<p>Note now that no iterations are needed to solve the model. This because the result of the previous solve is
used as a starting point for the new solve. It is even allowed to add or deleted variables and constraints in
the model, lpsolve will still try to start from the last result to continue.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you don't want this and let lpsolve resolve the model from scratch, there are two
possibilities to let lpsolve ignore the starting base. Either via an lpsolve option or an AMPL option.</p>

<p>The lpsolve option that can be set is:</p>
<pre>ampl: option lpsolve_options 'coldstart';
</pre>

<p>The AMPL option that can be set is:</p>
<pre>ampl: option send_statuses 0;
</pre>
<br>
One of both is enough.<br>
<br>
Now solve the model again:
<pre>ampl: solve;
</pre>

<p>This gives as result:</p>

<pre>LP_SOLVE 5.5.2.14: coldstart
LP_SOLVE 5.5.2.14: optimal, objective 88.2
3 simplex iterations
</pre>
<br>
Note that again 3 iterations are needed to solve the model.
<p>Special considerations for integer models. From the moment that a model contains integer variables,
the B&amp;B algorithm must be used to solve this. This algorithm must go trough a tree of possible solutions
each time a solve is done. The last base of the best integer solution can not be used as a starting base for
a resolve. This is not an lpsolve limitation, but a B&amp;B algorithm property...<br>
For this reason, by default, AMPL doesn't provide a starting to the solver and solve is done from scratch.
By default... However, a compromise can be implemented by the solver. And this is also done in lpsolve. Solving
integer models is always started with solving the non-integer model. When this is done, the non-integer variables
are made integer via the B&amp;B algorithm. lpsolve returns the base of the non-integer model and this base is
used as a starting base for the model at the next solve. As said, this is a compromise because it results in
a fast solve of the non-integer model, but the B&amp;B algorithm must still be executed. So even if no
modifications are done to the model and solve is done again, there will be iterations needed by the B&amp;B
algorithm to solve the integers. Because this must be explicitly implemented in the solver, AMPL doesn't
provide the starting base by default for integer models. It must explicitly be activated:</p>

<pre>ampl: option send_statuses 2;</pre>

<p>Only then, lpsolve will get a starting base when there are integers.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>ampl: model multmip3.mod;
ampl: data multmip3.dat;
ampl: option solver lpsolve;
ampl: solve;
</pre>

<p>This gives as result:</p>

<pre>LP_SOLVE 5.5.2.14: optimal, objective 235625
1986 simplex iterations
592 branch & bound nodes: depth 21
</pre>

<p>Note that 1986 iterations were needed to solve the model.
Now solve the model again:</p>
<pre>ampl: solve;
</pre>

<p>This gives as result:</p>

<pre>LP_SOLVE 5.5.2.14: optimal, objective 235625
1986 simplex iterations
592 branch & bound nodes: depth 21
</pre>

<p>The same as above. So no restart was done. Now activate the starting base for integer models and solve again:</p>

<pre>ampl: option send_statuses 2;
ampl: solve;
</pre>

<p>This gives as result:</p>

<pre>LP_SOLVE 5.5.2.14: optimal, objective 235625
1922 simplex iterations
592 branch & bound nodes: depth 21
</pre>

<p>Note that less iterations are needed, but not 0 as in non-integer models. These are the iterations needed
for the B&amp;B algorithm.</p>

<h3>lpsolve options</h3>

<p>lpsolve accepts a lot of options. Some options are just on/off switches and for there you just specify the
option keyword (for example scale). Other options need a value and this is specified by an equal (=) sign
after the option keyword and then the value (for example scalemode=7). Multiple options can be specified by
separating them by a space (for example scale scalemode=7).
</p>

<p>These options can be displayed from the command line by entering the following:</p>

<pre>
lpsolve -=

<p>Here is a list of the possible lpsolve options:</p>

<h3>lpsolve command line options</h3>

<p>Normally, the lpsolve program is called from AMPL. However the program can also be called stand-alone.
When the command is invoked without an option or with the option -?, a list of the possible options is shown:</p>

<pre>
usage: lpsolve [options] stub [-AMPL] [&lt;assignment&gt; ...]

Options:
        --  {end of options}
        -=  {show name= possibilities}
        -?  {show usage}
        -e  {suppress echoing of assignments}
        -s  {write .sol file (without -AMPL)}
        -v  {just show version}
</pre>

<p>stub and the -AMPL option is used when the program is called from AMPL.<br>
The -v option shows the version of lpsolve.<br>
The -= option shows all the options that can be passed to lpsolve from within AMPL.<br>
These options can also be specified in an environment variable lpsolve_options.<br>
<br>
To call the lpsolve command to solve a model, you first must have a stub file that can be read by lpsolve.
This stub file can be created by AMPL as follows:</p>

<pre>
ampl: model models\diet.mod;
ampl: data models\diet.dat;
ampl: write bdiet;
ampl: quit
</pre>

<p>This created a binary file diet.nl. As an alternative the command write gdiet; can be used.
This creates an ascii file that also can be read.
However it is somewhat slower to read, especially when the models are larger.</p>

<p>This creates a file diet.nl in the current directory. This file is the stub file needed by lpsolve:</p>

<pre>
lpsolve lpsolve diet.nl
</pre>

<p>This gives:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>Options can be passed to lpsolve via the environment variable lpsolve_options:</p>

<pre>
set lpsolve_options=scale scalemode=7 verbose
</pre>

<p>Then the result of the previous lpsolve command is:</p>

<pre>

<h3>Compile the AMPL driver</h3>

<p>Besides the specific lpsolve files, you also need the AMPL solvers files that must be linked with it.
These AMPL solvers files can be downloaded from various locations. The easiest way is via
<a href="http://netlib.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/netlib/netlibfiles.tar?filename=netlib/ampl/solvers">http://netlib.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/netlib/netlibfiles.tar?filename=netlib/ampl/solvers</a>.
untar them in directory lp_solve_5.5/extra/AMPL. This will put the files in lp_solve_5.5/extra/AMPL/solvers.
Then in the solvers directory, gunzip all the files with extension .gz.<br>
Then, still in the solvers directory, execute the appropriate Makefile.<br>
For example under Windows:<br>
nmake /f makefile.vc<br>
Under Unix this would be:<br>
make -f makefile.u<br>
This will generate amplsolv.lib under Windows and amplsolver.a under Unix systems.
However, Under windows, you must first create a file details.c by hand. It must contain the following single line:<br>
char sysdetails_ASL[] = "MS VC++ 6.0";<br>
See README for more information how to build the AMPL solvers files.
</p>

<p>Then install the files from archive lp_solve_5.5_AMPL_source.tar.gz<br>
When this is done, goto the lpsolve directory and execute the appropriate makefile.
There are two possibilities: generate a driver that links lpsolve statically and one that links lpsolve dynamically.
When linked dynamically, the lpsolve dll or shared library is used at runtime. When linked statically, the lpsolve static
library is linked at compile time with the AMPL lpsolve driver. For example:<br>
nmake /f makefile5dyn.vc<br>
Under Unix this would be:<br>
make -f makefile5dyn.u<br>
This will generate lpsolve.exe (Windows) or lpsolve (Unix). Put this in the AMPL directory.
