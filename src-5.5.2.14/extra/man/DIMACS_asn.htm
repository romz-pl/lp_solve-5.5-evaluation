                                        <p>DIMACS (Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (see <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/">http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/</a>))
                                           has formulated some 'challenges' for some specific problem instances (see <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/">http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/</a>).
                                           One of these challenges is network flows and matching - the first DIMACS implementation challenge.</p>

                                        <p>One of these network flows are assignment problems:<br><br>

                                           There are a number of agents and a number of tasks.
                                           Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the agent-task assignment.
                                           It is required to perform all tasks by assigning exactly one agent to each task in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.</p>

                                        <h3>Network Structure </h3>

                                        <ul>
                                        <li>
                                          A network is a directed graph with <i> n </i> nodes and <i> m </i> arcs.
                                        </li><li>
                                          Nodes are identified by integers 1...<i>n</i>.

                                        </li><li>
                                          Graphs do not have to be symmetric: if an arc <i>(v,w)</i> is in the graph,
                                          the reverse arc <i>(w,v)</i> does not have to be in the graph.
                                        </li><li>
                                          Parallel arcs are not allowed.
                                        </li><li>
                                          Self-loops are not allowed.
                                        </li><li>
                                          Arc capacities are 32-bit signed integers.

                                        </li><li>
                                          The source and the sink are distinct.
                                        </li><li>
                                          The sink may be unreachable from the source.
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>
                                           There is a specific file format available for these kinds of problems:
                                        </p>

<p>The following information makes up a DIMACS assignment problem input file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>comment lines </li>
  <li>problem line </li>
  <li>node descriptors </li>
  <li>arc descriptors </li>
</ul>

<p>As noted above, information is collected into <i>lines</i>, which begin with
one-character designators. We describe each type of information line in turn.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Comment Lines</b>: Comment lines give human-readable information about the file and
    are ignored by programs. Comment lines can appear anywhere in the file. Each comment line
    begins with a lower-case character <tt>c</tt>. <pre>    c This is an example of a comment line.</pre>
  </li>
  <li><b>Problem Line</b>: There is one problem line per input file. The problem line must
    appear before any node or arc descriptor lines. For assignment problem instances
    the problem line has the following format: <pre>    p asn NODES ARCS</pre>

    <p>The lower-case character <tt>p</tt> signifies that this is a problem line. The
    three-character problem designator <tt>asn</tt> identifies the file as containing
    specification information for an assignment problem. The <tt>NODES</tt> field
    contains an integer value specifying <i>n</i>, the number of nodes in the network.
    The <tt>ASCS</tt> field contains an integer value specifying <i>m</i>, the number of arcs in the network. </p>

  </li>
  <li><b>Node Descriptors</b>: All node descriptor lines must appear before all arc descriptor
    lines. For assignment problem instances, the node descriptor lines describe supply nodes.
    That is, only nodes with nonzero node supply
    values appear. There is one node descriptor line for each such node, with the following
    format. <pre>    n ID</pre>
    <p>The lower-case character <tt>n</tt> signifies that this is a node descriptor line. The <tt>ID</tt>
    field gives a node identification number, an integer between 1 and <i>n</i>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Arc Descriptors</b>: There is one arc descriptor line for each arc in the network.
    For an assignment problem instance, arc descriptor lines are of the following form.
    <pre>    a SRC DST COST</pre>
    <p>The lower-case character <tt>a</tt> signifies that this is an arc descriptor line. For
    a directed arc (<i>v,w</i>) the <tt>SRC</tt> field gives the identification number for the
    source vertex <i>v</i>, and the <tt>DST</tt> field gives the destination vertex <i>w</i>.
    Identification numbers are integers between 1 and <i>n</i>.
    The <tt>COST</tt> field contains the per-unit cost of flow sent along arc (<i>v,w</i>).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Input File Example :</h4>

<P>Consider the table below which shows the cost of allocating 5 jobs to
5 machines. </P>

<PRE>         Machine
      6  7  8  9  10
Job 1 22 30 26 16 25
    2 27 29 28 20 32
    3 33 25 21 29 23
    4 24 24 30 19 26
    5 30 33 32 37 31
</PRE>

<P>Which jobs should be allocated to which machines so as to minimise the
total cost? </P>

<UL>
<LI>each source (job) can supply one unit </LI>

<LI>each sink (machine) demands one unit </LI>

<LI>each arc has a capacity of one unit of flow and a cost taken from the
table above. </LI>
</UL>

<p align="center"><IMG alt="Assignment model graph" border="1" vspace="10" SRC="dimacs_asn.gif" HEIGHT=352 WIDTH=474></P>

<P>Problems of this type are called <I>assignment</I> problems since they
involve the assignment of n (in this case n=5) distinct entities to another
n distinct entities. For example in the area of production planning we
might be interested in assigning operators to machines, or in assigning
operators to jobs, or (as above) in assigning jobs to machines.</P>

                                        <p>lp_solve can read/write and solve these models via the xli_DIMACS XLI driver (see <a href="XLI.htm">External Language Interfaces</a>).
                                           It reads such a model in above format and solves it via linear programming.
                                           The xli can also generate a DIMACS formatted file.<br><br>
					   For example:</p>

<pre>
lp_solve -rxli xli_DIMACS assignment.net
</pre>
                                        <p>This gives as result:</p>

</pre>
                                        <p>Also from within the IDE, this XLI can be used. However, some entries
                                           must be added in LpSolveIDE.ini (in the folder where the IDE is installed).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>In the [XLI] section the following must be added:</p>
<pre>
lib6=xli_DIMACS
</pre>
                                        <p>And a new section for the DIMACS XLI must also be added:</p>
<pre>
[xli_DIMACS]
extension=.net
language=DIMACS
</pre>
                                        <p>Then make sure that the xli_DIMACS.dll is available for the IDE.
                                           This must be done by placing this dll in the IDE folder or in the
                                           Windows system32 folder.</p>

<h4>Solution :</h4>

                                        <p>The solution vector of above example is [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]<br>
                                           This must be interpreted as follows:<br>
                                           There are as many variables as there are arc descriptor lines in the input file and
                                           they appear in the same order. So:<br><br>
                                           C1 specifies how much flow there is for the first arc definition, in this case from 1 -&gt; 6<br>
                                           C2 specifies how much flow there is for the second arc definition, in this case from 1 -&gt; 7<br>
                                           ...<br>
                                           <br>
                                           This means there is a flow from node 1 to 6, a flow from node 2 to 9, a flow from node 3 to 8, a flow from node 4 to 7, a flow from node 5 to 10<br>
                                           This gives a total cost of 22 + 20 + 21 + 24 + 31 = 118
                                           <br>
                                           The value of the objective is the cost of the flow: 118
                                        </p>

<h4>Output :</h4>

                                        <p>The solution of the model can also be written in a DIMACS format:</p>


<ul>
  <li>comment lines </li>
  <li>solution lines </li>
  <li>flow assignments </li>
</ul>

<p>For each network problem, the solution is an <i>integer-valued</i> flow assignment. The
output file should list the solution and flow assignment for all arcs in the graph. As
noted above, information is collected into <i>lines</i>, which begin with one-character
designators. We describe each type of information line in turn.

<OL>
  <li><b>Comment Lines</b>: Comment lines give human-readable information about the file and
    are ignored by programs. Comment lines can appear anywhere in the file. Each comment line
    begins with a lower-case character <tt>c</tt>. <pre>    c This is an example of a comment line.</pre>
  </li>
  <LI>
    <B> Solution line. </B>

    The solution line contains the flow value and has the following format:
    <pre>    s VALUE</pre>

    <p>The lower-case character <tt>s</tt> signifies that this is a solution line.
    The <tt>VALUE</tt> field
    contains the value of the objective. </p>

  <LI>
    <B> Flow assignments. </B>
    There is one flow assignment line for each arc in the input network.
    These lines have the following format:

    <pre>    f SRC DST FLOW</pre>

    The lower-case character f signifies that this is a flow assignment line. For arc (u,v), the SRC and DST fields give v and w, respectively. The FLOW field gives the amount of flow assigned to arc (u,v).
</OL>

                                        <p>lp_solve can generate a solution file via the xli_DIMACS XLI driver (see <a href="XLI.htm">External Language Interfaces</a>).<br><br>
					   For example:</p>

<pre>
lp_solve -rxli xli_DIMACS assignment.net -wxlisol xli_DIMACS assignment.sol
</pre>
                                        <p>This generates the following solution contents:</p>

                                        <p>lp_solve can also generate a solution file with only non-zero values.<br><br>
					   For example:</p>

</pre>
                                        <p>This generates the following solution contents:</p>
