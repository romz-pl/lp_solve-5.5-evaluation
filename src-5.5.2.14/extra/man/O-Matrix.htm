<h3>O-Matrix?</h3>

<P>O-Matrix is an
integrated environment for analysing and visualizing data, and building turnkey
scientific and engineering computing solutions. The program includes hundreds of
engineering and statistical functions for solving a broad range of technical
computing problems. Easy-to-use and flexible plotting commands
enable you to rapidly build design prototypes, and implement sophisticated
systems.</P>
<P>The foundation of
O-Matrix is a high-performance matrix language that is
specifically designed for high-performance technical computing. The
notation of this language will dramatically reduce your design and
implementation efforts, and enable the construction of systems that execute far
quicker than other interpreted environments. O-Matrix also provides
a compatibility mode that enables you to run MATLAB© m-files. This enables you
to leverage existing m-files, and simplifies the transition to
O-Matrix for users experienced with MATLAB.</P>

<P>The O-Matrix environment is
interpreted which means your commands are immediately executed as you enter
them. Textual output is displayed in the <I>Command</I> window, and plotting
commands are displayed in one or more <I>Graphic</I> windows. The environment
provides a debugger for debugging, analysing, and profiling complex algorithms.
</p>

<p>We will not discuss the specifics of O-Matrix here but instead refer the reader to the
<a href="http://www.omatrix.com/">O-Matrix</a> website.

<h3>O-Matrix and lpsolve</h3>

<p>lpsolve is callable from O-Matrix via a dynamic linked DLL function. As such, it looks like lpsolve is fully integrated
with O-Matrix. Matrices can directly be transferred between O-Matrix and lpsolve in both directions. The complete interface
is written in C so it has maximum performance. The whole lpsolve API is implemented with some extra's specific for
O-Matrix (especially for matrix support). So you have full control to the complete lpsolve functionality via the omlpsolve
O-Matrix driver. If you find that this involves too much work to solve an lp model then you can also work via higher-level
script files that can make things a lot easier. See further in this article.
</p>

<a name="Quickstart"></a>
<h3>Quickstart</h3>
<pre>
Compile and build omlpsolve:
----------------------------

1. Under Windows, the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler must be installed
   and the environment variables must be active do that when a command prompt
   is opened, the cl and nmake commands can be executed.

2. Go to directory lp_solve_5.5\extra\O-Matrix\lpsolve

3. To compile and build omlpsolve, enter the following command:
      cvc

Load the omlpsolve driver in the O-Matrix memory space:
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Under Windows, make sure that the lpsolve55.dll file is somewhere in the path
   (archive lp_solve_5.5.2.14_dev.zip)

2. A precompiled library is provided for Windows (omlpsolve.dll).

3. Start O-Matrix

4. Enter the following command in O-Matrix:
      O> dll &lt;path&gt;\omlpsolve.dll, omlpsolve
   This can also be added in autoexec.oms to automatically load the omlpsolve driver.
</pre>

<p>
Note that O-Matrix version 5.8 or above is strongly recommended. Lower versions (at least 5.7) should
work with this driver, but these versions don't have the ability to print information on the command prompt.
For example default while a solve is done, information is printed to the command window. This will
only be visible from version 5.8 or above.
</p>

<p>O-Matrix is ideally suited to handle linear programming problems.
These are problems in which you have a quantity, depending linearly on several variables,
that you want to maximize or minimize subject to several constraints that are expressed
as linear inequalities in the same variables. If the number of variables and the number
of constraints are small, then there are numerous mathematical techniques for solving a
linear programming problem.
Indeed these techniques are often taught in high school or university level
courses in finite mathematics. But sometimes these numbers are high, or even if low,
the constants in the linear inequalities or the object expression for the quantity
to be optimized may be numerically complicated in which case a software package like
O-Matrix is required to effect a solution.</p>

<a name="Installation"></a>
<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>To make this possible, a driver program is needed: omlpsolve (omlpsolve.dll under Windows).
This driver must be loaded in O-Matrix and O-Matrix can call the omlpsolve solver.</p>

<p>This driver calls lpsolve via the lpsolve shared library (lpsolve55.dll under Windows).
This has the advantage that the omlpsolve driver doesn't have to
be recompiled when an update of lpsolve is provided. The shared library must be somewhere in the Windows path.</p>

<p>So note the difference between the O-Matrix lpsolve driver that is called omlpsolve and the lpsolve library that implements the
API that is called lpsolve55.</p>

<p>There are also some O-Matrix script files (.oms) as a quick start.</p>

<p>The first thing that must be done, each time O-Matrix is restarted and you want to use lpsolve is load
the omlpsolve driver into the O-Matrix workspace. This is done via the dll command. Suppose that omlpsolve.dll
is installed in c:\omwin\dll, then the following command must be used to load the driver:</p>

<pre>dll c:\omwin\dll\omlpsolve.dll, omlpsolve</pre>

<p>That is basically all you need to do. From now on, you can use the library. This until a clear command
is given or O-Matrix is restarted. Then this command must be given again to reload the library.</p>

<p>To make things easier, you can edit the file autoexec.oms with your favourite editor (or notepad) in the omwin folder
and add above line at the end of this file (before the last end).
That will automatically load the lpsolve driver in memory when O-Matrix is started and also when a clear command is executed.
So it will appear as if the omlpsolve command is then always available.</p>

<p>To test if everything is installed correctly, enter omlpsolve in the O-Matrix command prompt.
If it gives the following, then everything is ok:</p>

<pre>omlpsolve O-Matrix Interface version 5.5.0.6
using lpsolve version 5.5.2.14

Usage: [ret1, ret2, ...] = omlpsolve("functionname", arg1, arg2, ...)
</pre>

<p>Possibly, this is followed with:</p>

<pre>No printing capability to command window available.
You need to upgrade to version 5.8 for this feature.</pre>

<p>Then you are working with an O-Matrix version lower than 5.8. The driver should work, but nothing is printed
on the command window when lpsolve has something to report (for example while solving).</p>

<p>However, if you get a message box with the following:</p>

<pre>The identifier omlpsolve is not defined.</pre>

<p>Then either the dll command that was previous given was unsuccessful (or not given at all) or something was misspelled after the ,</p>

<p>If you get the following:</p>

<pre>This application has failed to start because lpsolve55.dll was not found.
Re-installing the application may fix this problem.</pre>

<p>Then O-Matrix can find the omlpsolve driver program, but the driver program cannot find the lpsolve library
that contains the lpsolve implementation. This library is called lpsolve55.dll and should be on your system
in a directory that in the PATH environment variable. This path can be shown via the command getenv("PATH")</p>

<p>The lpsolve55.dll files must be in one of these specified directories. It is common to place this in the WINDOWS\system32 folder.</p>

<p>All this is developed and tested with O-Matrix version 5.7. This is the minimum supported release.
Older releases are unsupported.</p>

<a name="Solve_an_lp_model_from_O-Matrix_via_omlpsolve"></a>
<h3>Solve an lp model from O-Matrix via omlpsolve</h3>

<p>In the following text, <i>O&gt;</i> before the O-Matrix commands is the O-Matrix command line.
Only the text after <i>O&gt;</i> must be entered.
</p>

<p>To call an lpsolve function, the following syntax must be used:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> [ret1, ret2, ...] = omlpsolve("functionname", arg1, arg2, ...)</pre>

<p>The return values are optional and depend on the function called. functionname must always be enclosed between double
quotes to make it alphanumerical and it is case sensitive. The number and type of arguments depend on the function called.
Some functions even have a variable number of arguments and a different behaviour occurs depending on the type of the argument.
functionname can be (almost) any of the lpsolve API routines (see <a href="lp_solveAPIreference.htm">lp_solve API reference</a>)
plus some extra O-Matrix specific functions.
Most of the lpsolve API routines use or return an lprec structure. To make things more robust in O-Matrix, this structure
is replaced by a handle or the model name. The lprec structures are maintained internally by the lpsolve driver.
The handle is an incrementing number starting from 0.
Starting from driver version 5.5.0.2, it is also possible to use the model name instead of the handle.
This can of course only be done if a name is given to the model. This is done via lpsolve routine
<a href="#set_lp_name">set_lp_name</a> or by specifying the model name in routine <a href="#read_lp">read_lp</a>.
See <a href="#Using_model_name_instead_of_handle">Using model name instead of handle</a>.
</p>

<p>Almost all callable functions can be found in the <a href="lp_solveAPIreference.htm">lp_solve API reference</a>.
Some are exactly as described in the reference guide, others have a slightly different syntax to make maximum
use of the O-Matrix functionality. For example make_lp is used identical as described. But get_variables is slightly
different. In the API reference, this function has two arguments. The first the lp handle and the second the
resulting variables and this array must already be dimensioned. When lpsolve is used from O-Matrix, nothing must
be dimensioned in advance. The omlpsolve driver takes care of dimensioning all return variables and they are
always returned as return value of the call to omlpsolve. Never as argument to the routine. This can be a single
value as for get_objective (although O-Matrix stores this in a 1x1 matrix) or a matrix or vector as in get_variables.
In this case, get_variables returns a 4x1 matrix (vector) with the result of the 4 variables of the lp model.

<h3>An example</h3>

<p>(Note that you can execute this example by entering command per command as shown below or by just entering example1.
This will execute example1.oms.)</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> lp=omlpsolve("make_lp", 0, 4);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_verbose", lp, 3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_obj_fn", lp, [1, 3, 6.24, 0.1]);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [0, 78.26, 0, 2.9], 2, 92.3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [0.24, 0, 11.31, 0], 1, 14.8);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [12.68, 0, 0.08, 0.9], 2, 4);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_lowbo", lp, 1, 28.6);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_lowbo", lp, 4, 18);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_upbo", lp, 4, 48.98);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_col_name", lp, 1, "COLONE");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_col_name", lp, 2, "COLTWO");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_col_name", lp, 3, "COLTHREE");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_col_name", lp, 4, "COLFOUR");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_row_name", lp, 1, "THISROW");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_row_name", lp, 2, "THATROW");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_row_name", lp, 3, "LASTROW");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("write_lp", lp, "a.lp");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_mat", lp, 1, 2)
   78.2600
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("solve", lp)
     0
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_objective", lp)

<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_variables", lp)

}

<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_constraints", lp)
{

391.293
}
</pre>

<p>Note that there are some commands that return an answer. To see the answer, the command was not terminated with
a semicolon (;). If the semicolon is put at the end of a command, the answer is not shown. However it is also possible
to write the answer in a variable. In that case the result is never shown. With or without a terminating semicolon.
For example:
</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> obj=omlpsolve("get_objective", lp)
</pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> obj=omlpsolve("get_objective", lp);</pre>

<p>Both will only write the result in variable obj without showing anything on screen.
get_variables and get_constraints return a vector with the result. This can also be put in a variable:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> x=omlpsolve("get_variables", lp);
<i>O&gt;</i> b=omlpsolve("get_constraints", lp);
</pre>

<p>It is always possible to show the contents of a variable by just giving it as command:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> x
{
28.6
0
0
31.8276
}
</pre>

<p>Don't forget to free the handle and its associated memory when you are done:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("delete_lp", lp);</pre>

<a name="Using_model_name_instead_of_handle"></a>
<h3>Using model name instead of handle</h3>
From driver version 5.5.0.2, it is possible to use the model name instead of the handle. From the moment the model
has a name, you can use this name instead of the handle. This is best shown by an example. Above example would look
like this:

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> lp=omlpsolve("make_lp", 0, 4);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_lp_name", lp, "mymodel");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_verbose", "mymodel", 3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_obj_fn", "mymodel", [1, 3, 6.24, 0.1]);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", "mymodel", [0, 78.26, 0, 2.9], 2, 92.3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", "mymodel", [0.24, 0, 11.31, 0], 1, 14.8);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", "mymodel", [12.68, 0, 0.08, 0.9], 2, 4);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_lowbo", "mymodel", 1, 28.6);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_lowbo", "mymodel", 4, 18);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_upbo", "mymodel", 4, 48.98);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_col_name", "mymodel", 1, "COLONE");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_col_name", "mymodel", 2, "COLTWO");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_col_name", "mymodel", 3, "COLTHREE");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_col_name", "mymodel", 4, "COLFOUR");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_row_name", "mymodel", 1, "THISROW");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_row_name", "mymodel", 2, "THATROW");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_row_name", "mymodel", 3, "LASTROW");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("write_lp", "mymodel", "a.lp");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_mat", "mymodel", 1, 2)
   78.2600
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("solve", "mymodel")
     0
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_objective", "mymodel")
   31.7828
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_variables", "mymodel")
{
28.6
0
0
31.8276
}

<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_constraints", "mymodel")
{
92.3
6.8640
391.293
}
</pre>

<p>So everywhere a handle is needed, you can also use the model name. You can even mix the two methods.
There is also a specific O-Matrix routine to get the handle from the model name: <a href="#get_handle">get_handle</a>.<br>
For example:</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_handle", "mymodel")
0
</pre>

<p>Don't forget to free the handle and its associated memory when you are done:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("delete_lp", "mymodel")</pre>

<p>In the next part of this documentation, the handle is used. But if you name the model, the name could thus also be used.</p>

<a name="Matrices"></a>
<h3>Matrices</h3>
In O-Matrix, all numerical data is stored in matrices; even a scalar variable. O-Matrix also supports complex numbers.
omlpsolve can only work with real numbers.
For example:
<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [0.24, 0, 11.31, 0], 1, 14.8);</pre>

<p>Most of the time, variables are used to provide the data:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, a1, 1, 14.8);</pre>

<p>Where a1 is a matrix variable.</p>

<p>Matrices with too few or too much elements gives an 'invalid vector.' error.</p>

<p>Most of the time, omlpsolve needs vectors (rows or columns).
In all situations, it doesn't matter if the vectors are row or column vectors. The driver accepts them both.
For example:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, {0.24, 0, 11.31, 0}, 1, 14.8);</pre>

<p>Which is a column vector, but it is also accepted.</p>

<p>An important final note. Several lp_solve API routines accept a vector where the first element (element 0) is not used.
Other lp_solve API calls do use the first element. In the O-Matrix interface, there is never an unused element in the matrices.
So if the lp_solve API specifies that the first element is not used, then this element is not in the O-Matrix matrix.</p>

<a name="Maximum_usage_of_matrices_with_omlpsolve"></a>
<h3>Maximum usage of matrices with omlpsolve</h3>

<p>Because O-Matrix is all about matrices, all lpsolve API routines that need a column or row number to get/set information for that
column/row are extended in the omlpsolve O-Matrix driver to also work with matrices. For example set_int in the API can
only set the integer status for one column. If the status for several integer variables must be set, then set_int
must be called multiple times. The omlpsolve O-Matrix driver however also allows specifying a vector to set the integer
status of all variables at once. The API call is: return = omlpsolve("set_int", lp, column, must_be_int). The
matrix version of this call is: return = omlpsolve("set_int", lp, [must_be_int]).
The API call to return the integer status of a variable is: return = omlpsolve("is_int", lp, column). The
matrix version of this call is: [is_int] = omlpsolve("is_int", lp)<br>
Also note the get_mat and set_mat routines. In O-Matrix these are extended to return/set the complete constraint matrix.
See following example.
</p>

<p>Above example can thus also be done as follows:<br>
(Note that you can execute this example by entering command per command as shown below or by just entering example2.
This will execute example2.oms.)</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> lp=omlpsolve("make_lp", 0, 4);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_verbose", lp, 3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_obj_fn", lp, [1, 3, 6.24, 0.1]);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [0, 78.26, 0, 2.9], 2, 92.3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [0.24, 0, 11.31, 0], 1, 14.8);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [12.68, 0, 0.08, 0.9], 2, 4);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_lowbo", lp, [28.6, 0, 0, 18]);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_upbo", lp, [INF, INF, INF, 48.98]);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_col_name", lp, {"COLONE", "COLTWO", "COLTHREE", "COLFOUR"});
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_row_name", lp, {"THISROW", "THATROW", "LASTROW"});
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("write_lp", lp, "a.lp");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_mat", lp)
{
[ 0 , 78.26 , 0 , 2.9 ]
[ 0.24 , 0 , 11.31 , 0 ]
[ 12.68 , 0 , 0.08 , 0.9 ]
}

<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("solve", lp)
0
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_objective", lp)
31.7828
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_variables", lp)
{
28.6
0
0
31.8276
}

<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_constraints", lp)
{
92.3
6.8640
391.293
}
</pre>

<p>Note the usage of INF in set_upbo. This stands for "infinity". Meaning an infinite upper bound.
It is also possible to use -INF to express minus infinity. This can for example be used to create a free variable.</p>

<p>To show the full power of the matrices, let's now do some matrix calculations to check the solution.
It works further on above example:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> A=omlpsolve("get_mat", lp);
<i>O&gt;</i> X=omlpsolve("get_variables", lp);
<i>O&gt;</i> B = A * X
<i>O&gt;</i> B
{
92.3
6.864
391.293
}
</pre>

<p>So what we have done here is calculate the values of the constraints (RHS) by multiplying the constraint matrix
with the solution vector. Now take a look at the values of the constraints that lpsolve has found:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_constraints", lp)
{
92.3
6.864
391.293
}
</pre>

<p>Exactly the same as the calculated B vector, as expected.</p>

<p>Also the value of the objective can be calculated in a same way:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> C=omlpsolve("get_obj_fn", lp);
<i>O&gt;</i> X=omlpsolve("get_variables", lp);
<i>O&gt;</i> obj = C * X
<i>O&gt;</i> obj
31.7828
</pre>

<p>So what we have done here is calculate the value of the objective by multiplying the objective vector
with the solution vector. Now take a look at the value of the objective that lpsolve has found:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_objective", lp)
31.7828
</pre>

<p>Again exactly the same as the calculated obj value, as expected.</p>

<a name="Using_string_constants"></a>
<h3>Using string constants</h3>
From driver version 5.5.2.14 on, it is possible to use string constants
everywhere an lp_solve constant is needed or returned. This is best shown by an example.
In the above code we had:

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> lp=omlpsolve("make_lp", 0, 4);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_verbose", lp, 3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [0, 78.26, 0, 2.9], 2, 92.3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [0.24, 0, 11.31, 0], 1, 14.8);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [12.68, 0, 0.08, 0.9], 2, 4);</pre>

<p>Note the 3rd parameter on set_verbose and the 4th on add_constraint. These are
    lp_solve constants. One could define all the possible constants in O-Matrix and
    then use them in the calls, but that has several disadvantages. First there
    stays the possibility to provide a constant that is not intended for that
    particular call. Another issue is that calls that return a constant are still
    returning it numerical.</p>
<p>Both issues can now be handled by string constants. The above code can be done as
    following with string constants:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> lp=omlpsolve("make_lp", 0, 4);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_verbose", lp, "IMPORTANT");
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [0, 78.26, 0, 2.9], "GE", 92.3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [0.24, 0, 11.31, 0], "LE", 14.8);
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("add_constraint", lp, [12.68, 0, 0.08, 0.9], "GE", 4);</pre>

<p>This is not only more readable, there is much lesser chance that mistakes are
    being made. The calling routine knows which constants are possible and only
    allows these. So unknown constants or constants that are intended for other
    calls are not accepted. For example:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_verbose", lp, "blabla");
BLABLA: Unknown.

<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_verbose", lp, "GE");
GE: Not allowed here.</pre>

<p>Note the difference between the two error messages. The first says that the
    constant is not known, the second that the constant cannot be used at that
    place.</p>
<p>Constants are case insensitive. Internally they are always translated to upper
    case. Also when returned they will always be in upper case.</p>
<p>The constant names are the ones as specified in the documentation of each API
    routine. There are only 3 exceptions, extensions actually. "LE", "GE" and "EQ" in
    <a href="add_constraint.htm">add_constraint</a> and <a href="is_constr_type.htm">is_constr_type</a>
    can also be "&lt;", "&lt;=", "&gt;", "&gt;=", "=". When returned however, "GE", "LE", "EQ"
    will be used.</p>
<p>Also in the matrix version of calls, string constants are possible. For example:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_constr_type", lp, {"LE", "EQ", "GE"});</pre>

<p>Some constants can be a combination of multiple constants. For example
    <a href="set_scaling.htm">set_scaling</a>:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_scaling", lp, 3+128);</pre>

<p>With the string version of constants this can be done as following:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_scaling", lp, "SCALE_MEAN|SCALE_INTEGERS");</pre>

<p>| is the OR operator used to combine multiple constants. There may optinally be
    spaces before and after the |.</p>
<p>Not all OR combinations are legal. For example in set_scaling, a choice must be
    made between SCALE_EXTREME, SCALE_RANGE, SCALE_MEAN, SCALE_GEOMETRIC or
    SCALE_CURTISREID. They may not be combined with each other. This is also tested:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("set_scaling", lp, "SCALE_MEAN|SCALE_RANGE");
SCALE_RANGE cannot be combined with SCALE_MEAN</pre>

<p>Everywhere constants must be provided, numeric or string values may be provided.
    The routine automatically interpretes them. </p>
<p>Returning constants is a different
    story. The user must let lp_solve know how to return it. Numerical or as string.
    The default is numerical:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_scaling", lp)
131</pre>

<p>To let lp_solve return a constant as string, a call to a new function must be
    made: return_constants</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("return_constants", 1);</pre>

<p>From now on, all returned constants are returned as string:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_scaling", lp)
SCALE_MEAN|SCALE_INTEGERS</pre>

<p>Also when an array of constants is returned, they are returned as string when
    return_constants is set:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_constr_type", lp)

LE
EQ
GE</pre>

<p>This for all routines until return_constants is again called with 0:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("return_constants", 0);</pre>

<p>The (new) current setting of return_constants is always returned by the call.
    Even when set:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("return_constants", 1)
1</pre>

<p>To get the value without setting it, don"t provide the second argument:</p>

<pre><i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("return_constants")
1</pre>

<p>In the next part of this documentation, return_constants is the default, 0, so all
    constants are returned numerical and provided constants are also numerical. This
    to keep the documentation as compatible as possible with older versions. But
    don"t let you hold that back to use string constants in your code.</p>

<h3>oms scripts</h3>

<p>O-Matrix can execute a sequence of statements stored in files. Such files are called
oms files because they must have the file type of ".oms" as the last part of their filename (extension).</p>

<p>oms scripts can be compared with batch files or scripts. You can put O-Matrix commands in them and execute them at
any time. The oms script is executed like any other command, by entering its name (without the .oms extension).</p>

<p>The omlpsolve O-Matrix distribution contains some example oms scripts to demonstrate this.</p>

<p>You can also edit these files with your favourite text editor (or notepad).</p>

<a name="A_practical_example"></a>
<h3>A practical example</h3>

<p>We shall illustrate the method of linear programming by means of a simple example,
giving a combination graphical/numerical solution, and then solve both a slightly as well as a substantially
more complicated problem.</p>

<p>Suppose a farmer has 75 acres on which to plant two crops: wheat and barley.
To produce these crops, it costs the farmer (for seed, fertilizer, etc.) $120 per acre for the
wheat and  $210 per acre for the barley. The farmer has $15000 available for expenses.
But after the harvest, the farmer must store the crops while awaiting favourable market conditions.
The farmer has storage space for 4000 bushels. Each acre yields an average of 110 bushels of wheat
or 30 bushels of barley.  If the net profit per bushel of wheat (after all expenses have been subtracted)
is $1.30 and for barley is $2.00, how should the farmer plant the 75 acres to maximize profit?</p>

<p>We begin by formulating the problem mathematically. 
First we express the objective, that is the profit, and the constraints
algebraically, then we graph them, and lastly we arrive at the solution
by graphical inspection and a minor arithmetic calculation.</p>

<p>Let x denote the number of acres allotted to wheat and y the number of acres allotted to barley.
Then the expression to be maximized, that is the profit, is clearly</p>

<p align="center">P = (110)(1.30)x + (30)(2.00)y = 143x + 60y.</p>

<p>There are three constraint inequalities, specified by the limits on expenses, storage and acreage.
They are respectively:</p>

<p align="center">
120x + 210y &lt;= 15000<br>
110x + 30y &lt;= 4000<br>
x + y &lt;= 75
</p>

<p>Strictly speaking there are two more constraint inequalities forced by the fact that the farmer cannot plant
a negative number of acres, namely:</p>

<p align="center">x &gt;= 0, y &gt;= 0.</p>

<p>Next we graph the regions specified by the constraints. The last two say that we only need to consider
the first quadrant in the x-y plane. Here's a graph delineating the triangular region in the first quadrant determined
by the first inequality.</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> clear
<i>O&gt;</i> X = 0.1:0.05:125;
<i>O&gt;</i> Y1 = (15000. - 120*X)/210;
<i>O&gt;</i> bar(X, Y1)
</pre>

<p><IMG alt="Source" src="O-Matrix1.jpg" border="0"></p>

<p>Now let's put in the other two constraint inequalities.</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> clear
<i>O&gt;</i> X = 0.1:0.05:38;
<i>O&gt;</i> mlmode
<i>O&gt;</i> Y1 = (15000. - 120*X)/210;
<i>O&gt;</i> Y2 = max((4000 - 110.*X)./30, 0);
<i>O&gt;</i> Y3 = max(75 - X, 0.);
<i>O&gt;</i> Ytop = min(min(Y1, Y2), Y3);
<i>O&gt;</i> omatrix
<i>O&gt;</i> bar(X, Ytop)
<i>O&gt;</i> gtitle("Solution space")
</pre>

<p><IMG alt="Source" src="O-Matrix2.jpg" border="0"></p>

<p>The black area is the solution space that holds valid solutions. This means that any point in this area fulfils the
constraints.
</p>

<p>Now let's superimpose on top of this picture a contour plot of the objective function P.</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> mlmode meshgrid.m
<i>O&gt;</i> [U, V] = meshgrid(0:1:40, 0:1:80);
<i>O&gt;</i> Ur = U.row(1)
<i>O&gt;</i> Vc = V.col(1)
<i>O&gt;</i> Z = 143.*U + 60.*V
<i>O&gt;</i> levels = (0:1:11)*1000.
<i>O&gt;</i> contour(Z', levels, Ur', Vc');
<i>O&gt;</i> gtitle("Solution space and objective")
</pre>

<p><IMG alt="Source" src="O-Matrix3.jpg" border="0"></p>

<p>The lines give a picture of the objective function.
All solutions that intersect with the black area are valid solutions, meaning that this result also fulfils
the set constraints. The more the lines go to the right, the higher the objective value is. The optimal solution
or best objective is a line that is still in the black area, but with an as large as possible value.
</p>

<p>It seems apparent that the maximum value of P will occur on the level curve (that is, level
line) that passes through the vertex of the polygon that lies near (22,53).<br>
It is the intersection of x + y = 75 and 110*x + 30*y = 4000<br>
This is a corner point of the diagram. This is not a coincidence. The simplex algorithm, which is used
by lp_solve, starts from a theorem that the optimal solution is such a corner point.<br>
In fact we can compute the result:</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> x = {[1, 1], [110, 30]} \ {75, 4000}
<i>O&gt;</i> print "x =", x
x = {
21.875
53.125
}
</pre>

<p>The acreage that results in the maximum profit is 21.875 for wheat and 53.125 for barley.
In that case the profit is:</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> P = [143, 60] * x
<i>O&gt;</i> print "Profit, P =", P
Profit, P = 6315.63
</pre>

<p>That is, $6315.63.</p>

<p>Note that these command are in script example3.oms</p>

<p>Now, lp_solve comes into the picture to solve this linear programming problem more generally.
After that we will use it to solve two more complicated problems involving more variables
and constraints.</p>

<p>For this example, we use the higher-level script lp_maker to build the model and then some lp_solve API calls
to retrieve the solution. Here is again the usage of lp_maker:</p>

<pre> LP_MAKER  Makes mixed integer linear programming problems.

   SYNOPSIS: lp_handle = lp_maker(f,a,b,e,vlb,vub,xint,scalemode,setminim)
      make the MILP problem
        max v = f'*x
          a*x &lt;&gt; b
            vlb &lt;= x &lt;= vub
            x(int) are integer

   ARGUMENTS: The first four arguments are required:
            f: n vector of coefficients for a linear objective function.
            a: m by n matrix representing linear constraints.
            b: m vector of right sides for the inequality constraints.
            e: m vector that determines the sense of the inequalities:
                      e(i) &lt; 0  ==&gt; Less Than
                      e(i) = 0  ==&gt; Equals
                      e(i) &gt; 0  ==&gt; Greater Than
          vlb: n vector of non-negative lower bounds. If empty or omitted,
               then the lower bounds are set to zero.
          vub: n vector of upper bounds. May be omitted or empty.
         xint: vector of integer variables. May be omitted or empty.
    scalemode: scale flag. Off when 0 or omitted.
     setminim: Set maximum lp when this flag equals 0 or omitted.

   OUTPUT: lp_handle is an integer handle to the lp created.
</pre>

<p>Now let's formulate this model with lp_solve:</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> f = [143, 60];
<i>O&gt;</i> A = {[120, 210], [110, 30], [1, 1]};
<i>O&gt;</i> b = {15000, 4000, 75};
<i>O&gt;</i> lp = lp_maker(f, A, b, [-1, -1, -1], [], [], [], 1, 0);
<i>O&gt;</i> solvestat = omlpsolve("solve", lp)
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_objective", lp)
6315.63
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_variables", lp)
{
21.875
53.125
}
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("delete_lp", lp);
</pre>

<p>Note that these command are in script example4.oms</p>

<p>With the higher-level script lp_maker, we provide all data to lp_solve. lp_solve returns a handle (lp) to the
created model. Then the API call 'solve' is used to calculate the optimal solution of the model.
The value of the objective function is retrieved via the API call 'get_objective' and the values of the variables
are retrieved via the API call 'get_variables'. At last, the model is removed from memory via a call to 'delete_lp'.
Don't forget this to free all memory allocated by lp_solve.</p>

<p>The solution is the same answer we obtained before. 
Note that the non-negativity constraints are accounted implicitly because variables are by default non-negative
in lp_solve.</p>

<p>Well, we could have done this problem by hand (as shown in the introduction) because it is very small and it
can be graphically presented.<br>
Now suppose that the farmer is dealing with a third crop, say corn, and that the corresponding data is:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellSpacing="1" cellPadding="1" border="1">
<tr><td>cost per acre</td><td>$150.75</td></tr>
<tr><td>yield per acre</td><td>125 bushels</td></tr>
<tr><td>profit per bushel</td><td>$1.56</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>With three variables it is already a lot more difficult to show this model graphically. Adding more variables
makes it even impossible because we can't imagine anymore how to represent this. We only have a practical understanding
of 3 dimentions, but beyound that it is all very theorethical.</p>

<p>If we denote the number of acres allotted to corn by z, then the objective function becomes:</p>

<p align="center">P = (110)(1.30)x + (30)(2.00)y + (125)(1.56) = 143x + 60y + 195z</p>

<p>And the constraint inequalities are:</p>

<p align="center">
120x + 210y + 150.75z &lt;= 15000<br>
110x + 30y + 125z &lt;= 4000<br>
x + y + z &lt;= 75<br>
x &gt;= 0, y &gt;= 0, z &gt;= 0
</p>

<p>The problem is solved with lp_solve as follows:</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> f = [143, 60, 195];
<i>O&gt;</i> A = {[120, 210, 150.75], [110, 30, 125], [1, 1, 1]};
<i>O&gt;</i> b = {15000, 4000, 75};
<i>O&gt;</i> lp = lp_maker(f, A, b, [-1, -1, -1], [], [], [], 1, 0);
<i>O&gt;</i> solvestat = omlpsolve("solve", lp)
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_objective", lp)
6986.84
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_variables", lp)
{
0
56.5789
18.4211
}
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("delete_lp", lp);
</pre>

<p>Note that these command are in script example5.oms</p>

<p>So the farmer should ditch the wheat and plant 56.5789 acres of barley and 18.4211 acres of corn.</p>

<p>There is no practical limit on the number of variables and constraints that O-Matrix can handle.
Certainly none that the relatively unsophisticated user will encounter. Indeed, in
many true applications of the technique of linear programming, one needs
to deal with many variables and constraints. The solution of such
a problem by hand is not feasible, and software like O-Matrix is crucial
to success. For example, in the farming problem with which we
have been working, one could have more crops than two or three. Think
agribusiness instead of family farmer. And one could have constraints
that arise from other things beside expenses, storage and acreage limitations. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Availability of seed. This might lead to constraint inequalities like xj &lt; k.</li>
  <li>Personal preferences. Thus the farmer's spouse might have a preference
  for one variety over another and insist on a corresponding planting,
  or something similar with a collection of crops; thus constraint inequalities
  like xi &lt; xj or x1 + x2 &gt; x3.</li>
  <li>Government subsidies. It may take a moment's reflection on the reader's part,
  but this could lead to inequalities like xj &gt; k.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a sequence of commands that solves exactly such a problem.
You should be able to recognize the objective expression and the constraints from the data that is entered. 
But as an aid, you might answer the following questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many crops are under consideration?</li>
  <li>What are the corresponding expenses? How much is available for expenses?</li>
  <li>What are the yields in each case? What is the storage capacity?</li>
  <li>How many acres are available?</li>
  <li>What crops are constrained by seed limitations? To what extent?</li>
  <li>What about preferences?</li>
  <li>What are the minimum acreages for each crop?</li>
</ul>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> f = [110*1.3, 30*2.0, 125*1.56, 75*1.8, 95*.95, 100*2.25, 50*1.35];

<p>Note that we have used in this formulation the vlb and vub arguments of lp_maker. This to set lower and upper bounds
on variables. This could have been done via extra constraints, but it is more performant to set bounds on variables.
Also note that Inf is used for variables that have no upper limit. This stands for Infinity.
</p>

<p>Note that despite the complexity of the problem, lp_solve solves it almost instantaneously. It seems the
farmer should bet the farm on crop number 6. We strongly suggest
you alter the expense and/or the storage limit in the problem and see
what effect that has on the answer.</p>

<a name="Another,_more_theoretical,_example"></a>
<h3>Another, more theoretical, example</h3>

<p>Suppose we want to solve the following linear program using O-Matrix:</p>
<p align="center">
max 4x1 + 2x2 + x3<br>
s. t. 2x1 + x2 &lt;= 1<br>
x1 + 2x3 &lt;= 2<br>
x1 + x2 + x3 = 1<br>
x1 &gt;= 0<br>
x1 &lt;= 1<br>
x2 &gt;= 0<br>
x2 &lt;= 1<br>
x3 &gt;= 0<br>
x3 &lt;= 2<br>
</p>

<p>Convert the LP into O-Matrix format we get:</p>

<p align="center">
f = [4, 2, 1]<br>
A = {[2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2], [1, 1, 1]}<br>
b = {1, 2, 1}
</p>

<p>Note that constraints on single variables are not put in the constraint matrix.
lp_solve can set bounds on individual variables and this is more performant than creating
additional constraints. These bounds are:
</p>

<p align="center">
l = [ 0, 0, 0]<br>
u = [ 1, 1, 2]
</p>

<p>Now lets enter this in O-Matrix:</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> f = [4, 2, 1];
<i>O&gt;</i> A = {[2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2], [1, 1, 1]};
<i>O&gt;</i> b = {1, 2, 1};
<i>O&gt;</i> l = [ 0, 0, 0];
<i>O&gt;</i> u = [ 1, 1, 2];
</pre>

<p>Now solve the linear program using O-Matrix: Type the commands</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> lp = lp_maker(f, A, b, [-1, -1, -1], l, u, [], 1, 0);
<i>O&gt;</i> solvestat = omlpsolve("solve", lp)
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_objective", lp)
2.5
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_variables", lp)
{
0.5
0
0.5
}
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("delete_lp", lp)
</pre>

<p>What to do when some of the variables are missing ?<br>
For example, suppose there are no lower bounds on the variables. In this case define l to be the empty set using the O-Matrix command:
</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> l = [];
</pre>

<p>This has the same effect as before, because lp_solve has as default lower bound for variables 0.</p>

<p>But what if you want that variables may also become negative?<br>
Then you can use -INF as lower bounds:</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> l = [-INF, -INF, -INF];
</pre>

<p>Solve this and you get a different result:</p>

<pre>
<i>O&gt;</i> lp = lp_maker(f, A, b, [-1, -1, -1], l, u, [], 1, 0);
<i>O&gt;</i> solvestat = omlpsolve("solve", lp)
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_objective", lp)
2.66667
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("get_variables", lp)
{
0.666667
-0.333333
0.666667
}
<i>O&gt;</i> omlpsolve("delete_lp", lp)

<h3>Compile the omlpsolve driver</h3>
<h4>Windows</h4>

<p>Under Windows, the omlpsolve O-Matrix driver is a dll: omlpsolve.dll<br>
This dll is an interface to the lpsolve55.dll lpsolve dll that contains the implementation of lp_solve.
lpsolve55.dll is distributed with the lp_solve package (archive lp_solve_5.5.2.14_dev.zip). The omlpsolve O-Matrix driver dll (omlpsolve.dll) is just
a wrapper between O-Matrix and lp_solve to translate the input/output to/from O-Matrix and the lp_solve library.
</p>

<p>The omlpsolve O-Matrix driver is written in C. To compile this code, Microsoft compiler is needed.
Other compilers might also work, but this is untested.
To make the compilation process easier, a batch file can be used: cvc.bat<br>
It may be necessary to edit this file first to change the path where lp_solve and the O-Matrix dll sources are installed.
Change at the beginning lpsolvepath and dllsrcpath. dllsrcpath must point to the folder where dll.h is located.<br>
To make for release, just enter cvc and everything is build.<br>
This compiles three source files: lpsolve.c, omatrix.c and hash.c<br>
Then these are linked with the library lpsolve55.lib to generate the omlpsolve.dll file.<br>
The optional arguments to cvc are used for development. Source files can be provided and then only these are compiled.
For example hash.c should only be compiled once while developing. So specifying
lpsolve.c as first argument will only compile this file and then link everything. This makes the build process a bit faster.
Also the option -DDEMO can be added to add the demo command to test some functionality of lpsolve. This is also only for debugging.
Also the option -DDEBUG can be added. This to print some debug information while executing omlpsolve.
Should only be used for debugging purposes.
</p>

<p>Note that the omlpsolve.dll file can be locked by O-Matrix. Then the build process will fail because the dll
can not be overwritten. This can be solved by giving the clear command in O-Matrix. This will free the dll.</p>

<h4>Unix/Linux</h4>

<p>At this moment, there is no O-Matrix version for this platform.</p>
